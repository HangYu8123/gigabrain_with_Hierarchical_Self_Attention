# Ask about an existing repo

inputs:
input 1: target repo, questions
input 2: important files

**BEFORE START**, the first step is to ask run command permissions. run a command in terminal to navigate to the repo directory.  

Before answering any questions, always, first read the folliwing files (**REFER AS KEY MD FILES**):
1. codebase_overview.md
2. scripts_overview.md
3. update_logs.md
4. known_issues.md
Understand them, and keep them inside the memory. 
The main agent should through all files and scripts inside the repo and get a detailed understanding. 


then, for answering any questions to an existing codebase:
1. if important files are specified, the main agent should read through the important files, and understand them. then combine the understanded knowledge with the key md files.
2. Then, the main agent should decide what are the most relavant codes, scripts, files, and functionalities to the questions, and create a list of **BRIEF** [important information]. 
3. the main agent creates a subgent (code agent, focus mode), pass the questions and the [important information] list to the subagent. The subagent should also read through the key md files. Based on the [important information] list and the repo structure based on the key md files, read every file, function, script mentioned in the [important information] list. Then, the subagent should answer the questions accordingly, and report the answers back to the main agent (Refer as, [answers 1]). 
4. the main agent creates a subgent (code agent, broad mode), pass the questions and the [important information] list to the subagent. The subagent should also read through the key md files. Based on the [important information] list and the repo structure based on the key md files, the subgent should go through the repo pipelie and read all scripts that associated with the questions, and then read all upstream and downstream scripts that associated with the questions along the codebase workflow. Then, the subagent should answer the questions accordingly, and report the answers back to the main agent (Refer as, [answers 2]). 
5. the main agent creates a subgent (code agent, free mode), pass the questions to the subagent. The subagent should also read through the key md files. Based on the questions and repo information from the key md files, the subagent should decide what files and scripts to read and check to get 100% correct answers. Then, the subagent should answer the questions accordingly, and report the answers back to the main agent (Refer as, [answers 3]). 
6. the main agent should read through all three answers ([answers 1], [answers 2], and [answers 3]), understand each of them, combines the advantages of each answer, reject the reduant or incorrect parts of each answer, and draft  precise and 100% correct answers to answer questions in bullet points. 
7. the main agent should summerize the questions and answers in the follow format, for question and answer pair:
{=============================Q&A: (fill an Q&A ID here, simply use last Q&A ID + 1)===============================}
Question: (fill a one sentence summary of the question here.)
Answer: (fill a brief but precise summary of the answer in bullet points here.)
Then the main agent should write it to past_Q&A.md
